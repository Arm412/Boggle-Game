# Boggle-Game
A program that plays Boggle.  
When you run the program, there needs to be a few arguments. Acceptable arguments would be: "-b board1.txt -d dlb" - "-b board1.txt -d simple" - "-b board2.txt -d dlb" - "-b board2.txt -d simple" 
Once the program is running, either the SimpleDictionary or De La Briandais Dictionary (DLB) will be used to find the words.
